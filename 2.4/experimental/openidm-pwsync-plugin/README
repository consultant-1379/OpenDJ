This folder contains source code for the OpenIDM password synchronization
extension to OpenDJ. This extensions implements a password capture feature
leveraging the Account Status Notification Handler interface, and OpenIDM
specific transport to communicate the password changes to OpenIDM for
synchronization with other systems.

In order to build and use this extension, perform the following
steps (presumably you are already at step 3):

  1. In the top-level source folder for OpenDJ, first build and
     package OpenDJ:

     ./build.sh

  2. Next go into the openidm-pwsync-plugin folder:

     cd experimental/openidm-pwsync-plugin

  3. Retrieve the jars required to build this extension:

     // TBD

  4. And build the plugin (this requires Ant version 7 or higher in your path):

     ant install

  6. This will copy the following files into the parent OpenDJ
     default installation (build/package/OpenDJ-X.Y.Z):

     INSTANCE_ROOT/lib/extensions/openidm-pwsync-plugin.jar
     INSTANCE_ROOT/config/openidm-pwsync-plugin-config.ldif
     INSTANCE_ROOT/config/schema/90-openidm-pwsync-plugin.ldif

  7. Add the plugin's config to the server configuration. The
     following instruction assumes usage of the Unix 'cat'
     command, but obviously ldapadd (ldapmodify -a) can be used:

     cd INSTANCE_ROOT/config
     cat openidm-pwsync-plugin-config.ldif >> config.ldif

  8. Start the server and look for the
     "openidm-account-status-notification-handler" notice in the start up log:

     cd INSTANCE_ROOT
     ./bin/start-ds
